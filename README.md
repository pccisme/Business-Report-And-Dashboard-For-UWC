# Business-Report-And-Dashboard-For-UWC

Course: INF 385T Presenting Information

### Description

Every time students come to the University of Writing Center (UWC) to seek help from the writing consultants, the UWC records details of consultations. Based on the data, we can find the features of students. This report provides an analysis of consulting services and illustrates the aspects of consultations and the profiles of students by charts and tables.

### Analysis

The analysis shows that April and October are the peak seasons for the UWC. Moreover, the students often bring their essays (34%) to the UWC and most students come from the College of Liberal Arts (21%). The result also demonstrates the top-three primary languages of ESL (English as a second or foreign language): Spanish, Chinese, and Korean. Additionally, over seventy percent of students claim they fully understand assignment requirements before they come to the UWC. Lastly, the gender ratio of women to men is almost two to one. Females account for sixty-three percent and males account for only twenty-nine
percent.

### Result

According to the analysis results, providing the solution for peak seasons is necessary. As a suggestion, starting the drop-in services could be a good idea. In off-seasons, seminars for students, who are working on essays, should be popular, especially for the students in the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Natual Sciences.

Lastly, further research on the relationship between ESL studentsâ€™ primary languages and the difficulty of writing in English is needed.
